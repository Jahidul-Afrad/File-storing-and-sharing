# File-storing-and-sharing
#	Introduction
The students of BSMRSTU often faces the decision of whether it would be quicker to wait for storing file on a secure website.  Many students are often needing to store file with secure but they can’t do it because most of the website which store file that are not secure. After analyzing the requirements of the task to be performed, the next step is to analyze the problem and understand its context. The first activity in the phase is studying the existing system and other is to understand the requirements and domain of the new system. Both the activities are equally important, but the first activity serves as a basis of giving the functional specifications and then successful design of the proposed system. Understanding the properties and requirements of a new system is more difficult and requires creative thinking and understanding of existing running system is also difficult, improper understanding of present system can lead diversion from solution.


#	Background and Present State
Background theory in this project work serves as prophase for developing an application. That allows us to understand more compatibly the principals and technologies of Java Website development and can give us idea about further structure of prototype project. JAVA is one of an Open source platforms which is platform independent. It is created by Google and owned by Open Handset Alliance. It is designed with goal “accelerate innovation in 2500 million devices” As such java has taken over a field of platform independent innovation. It is definitely free and open platform that differs hardware from software that runs on it. It results for much more devices be running the same application. Also it gives possibility of friendlier environment for developers and consumers. Java it is complete software package for any operating system. Since the beginning java team offers the developing kit (tool and frameworks) for creating operating system quick and easy as possible. In some cases you do not specially need a java language but you are very welcome to have one. It can work right out of the box, but of course users can customize it for their particular needs. For manufactures it is ready and free solution for their devices. Any operating system of the world, java is community provides everything else to create their devices


# Objectives
The main objectives for this projects are listed below:
	Maintain and improve the regional website system
	The purpose of this system will manage a file sharing site.
	Improve the safety and security of the regional file for all users.
	Preserve, protect, and enhance the natural and human environment.
	To make more accessible and constantly updated dynamic website for uploading file in cloud.


# Methodology 

# JAVA 
There is no doubt that Java is one of the programming languages that is most in demand these days. Here, we have scooped a handful of good info about trending frameworks that ease everyday lives of software developers around the globe.
As per a survey conducted by RebelLabs, the media ally for the online Java User Group (Virtual JUG).

# Rapid website development method  
This method is directed by producing high quality system in most efficient time costs. Also it allows to divide project into smaller parts and develop them separately. It’s basic idea to produce high quality system quickly by use of interactive Prototyping. It emphasizes on satisfaction the business requirements. It sets strict deadlines and if project slips the schedule, the emphasis is set to reducing requirements and not on changing deadlines. The prototypes are giving to the user for evaluation.  (CMS 2008).


# Experimental Overview 
# NUMBER OF MODULES
The system after careful analysis has been identified to be presented with the following modules:

The Modules involved are
1.	Administration
2.	Users
3.	File Uploading and Downloading
4.	File Sharing
5.	Registration
6.	Search
7.	Reports
8.	Authentication


# Administration
	Administrator has an authentication to monitoring the complete system.  He can have all the privileges.  Administrator can register user directly, and delete the information of a registered users.
	He verifies the information uploads into the system by the users. If any mismanagement done by the user immediately he can delete the information uploaded earlier by the user.



# File Type: 
Administrator can add different type of file types, therefore user can upload files for that file types only. The file types normally
•	Word File
•	PDF file
•	Text File
•	Images

# Registration
The system has a process of registration.  Every user need to submit his complete details in the form of registration.  Whenever a user registration completed automatically user can get a user id and password.  By using that user id and password user can log into the system.


# File Uploading and Sharing
All registered user having authority to upload any file into the system, admin can track all uploaded files.  Based on the priority users can down load file from the system.  For file uploading and downloading the system provides a good user interface for easy to use.  User can save the downloading file with his desired location.


# Software Requirements:
•	WINDOWS OS (XP / 2000 / 200 Server / 2003 Server)
•	Netbeans (IDE)
•	Java
•	JSP
•	Servlet 
•	JDBC                      
•	SQL Server 2005 Enterprise Edition


# Conclusion
The conclusions of this study suggest that knowledge of specific domain improves the results. This Project has been implemented on java which is platform independent. Also, different attributes have been added to the project which will prove to be advantageous to the system. The requirements and specifications have been listed above. This project is implemented using core java, jsp, servlet and the mysql domain. Using encrypt and decrypt system, the file will upload on a secure process. It’s a web-enabled project. This project offers user to enter the data through simple and interactive forms which is very security provided and faster accessing.
 It uses basic measurements of distance between two locations and provides necessary details of each and every route for people to easily pick up buses or any other conveyance possible on the specified route. Specific location details are provided to the user along with bus no. so that the person can identify the bus correctly. It uses remote server as its database. Due to this the records can be easily manipulated on the device itself and the server burden gets reduced.
